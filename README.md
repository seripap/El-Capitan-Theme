# El Capitan Theme

This is a dark version of the El Capitan theme created by [Ricci Adams](https://github.com/iccir). 

This README needs to be updated big time to reflect that. Most of the following is the same README from the original theme.

At the moment this theme is not 100% functional. I hope for it to be that way early next week! However - it does, for the most part, work well on retina displays.

## Installation

El Capitan theme is designed to work with the latest development builds of [Sublime Text 3](http://www.sublimetext.com/3dev).

### Using Sublime Package Control

(Needs to be updated to reflect two different theme options)

(Investigate Package Control)
<!--If you are using Will Bond's excellent [Sublime Package Control](http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control), you can easily install Soda Theme via the `Package Control: Install Package` menu item. The Soda Theme package is listed as `Theme - Soda` in the packages list.-->

### Using Git

(Needs to be updated to reflect two different theme options)

Alternatively, if you are a git user, you can install the theme and keep up to date by cloning the repo directly into your `Packages` directory in the Sublime Text application settings area.

You can locate your Sublime Text `Packages` directory by using the menu item `Preferences -> Browse Packages...`.

While inside the `Packages` directory, clone the theme repository using the command below:

    git clone https://github.com/iccir/El-Capitan-Theme/ "Theme - El Capitan"

### Download Manually

(Needs to be updated to reflect two different theme options)

* Download the files using the GitHub .zip download option
* Unzip the files and rename the folder to `Theme - El Capitan`
* Find your `Packages` directory using the menu item  `Preferences -> Browse Packages...`
* Copy the folder into your Sublime Text `Packages` directory

## Activating the theme

To configure Sublime Text to use the theme, follow the instructions below for your specific version.

### Sublime Text 3

(Needs to be updated to reflect two different theme options)

* Open your User Settings Preferences file `Sublime Text -> Preferences -> Settings - User`
* Add (or update) your theme entry to be `"theme": "El Capitan.sublime-theme"`

**Example Sublime Text 3 User Settings**

    {
        "theme": "El Capitan.sublime-theme"
    }


### Code Font

The code font shown in the light screenshot is Monaco, in the dark is Panic Sans.

## Development

Please note, Sublime Text dev builds move quickly and changes can occur with the theme API between releases, so there may be occasions where the theme doesn't quite work with a brand new dev release.
